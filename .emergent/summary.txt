The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Empresas Web CRM from conception to a highly functional MVP. Initial efforts focused on core CRM features, department management, and fundamental AI integration, notably refactoring MongoDB ObjectIDs to UUIDs and ensuring robust environment variable loading. A significant phase involved overhauling the UI to a Youseller inspired design, implementing specialized AI assistants, and establishing an administration area. The engineer diligently addressed critical bug reports, particularly complex authentication flow issues involving  and  mismatches, and persistent  modal rendering problems, debugging them through iterative testing and  insights. All major functional gaps, including interactive buttons for scheduling, messaging, and AI management, were implemented and validated. The most recent work commenced on a new, substantial feature: developing a Chrome extension for advanced WhatsApp Web automation and CRM functionalities.

<product_requirements>
The Empresas Web application is a sophisticated CRM system with deep WhatsApp Web integration and advanced AI capabilities, aiming to replicate the YouSeler experience. Key features include a responsive PWA with a floating sidebar and vibrant UI; dual WhatsApp integration (official Cloud API and QR) supporting multi-numbers and session persistence; seven specialized AI assistants per department, configurable with instructions, signatures, and multimedia interpretation. A comprehensive administrator area manages company profiles, users, departments, and AI settings, including RBAC. The Atendimento (WhatsApp) interface features a 3-column layout, full ReplyBar functionality (attachments, emojis, AI Assist, mandatory signatures), contact management, group participation, and real-time updates via WebSocket. CRM functionalities include Kanban funnels, keyword-based automations, and mass sending. Security features prioritize on-premise data storage, 2FA, encryption, and granular RBAC. An AI orchestrator selects optimal LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude). The user prioritizes rapid evolution of the existing system.

<code_architecture>
The application is a full-stack web application with distinct frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) components.



**High-Level Architecture:**
The React frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend using  and  prefix for routes. The backend interacts with a MongoDB database via . Services are managed by Supervisor within a Kubernetes environment. AI capabilities are integrated via  library, utilizing the Emergent LLM key. A new Chrome extension is being developed to enhance WhatsApp Web with CRM features, communicating with the existing backend.

**Detailed Directory Structure and File Importance:**

-   :
    -   : Python dependencies.  and  are notable additions.
    -   : Main FastAPI application.
        -   **Importance**: Defines API endpoints, business logic for CRM, AI, departments, and authentication.
        -   **Changes**: Loaded  using . Implemented AI responses, department management (creation, retrieval, updates) with new fields (, , ). Added WhatsApp QR code generation. Crucially,  was implemented for  to UUID conversion. Added user registration/login endpoints. Implemented new endpoints for contacts, appointments, scheduled messages. Added preliminary endpoints for Chrome extension integration (companies, extension settings). Corrected  usage in endpoints.
-   :
    -   : Main React component, central to the application's UI, routing, and state.
        -   **Importance**: Handles global state, navigations, conditional rendering of main application sections (Dashboard, Atendimentos, etc.).
        -   **Changes**: Implemented state for departments and transfers. Refactored UI for a modern Youseller design (sidebar, dashboard). Integrated department signature. Created and integrated administration area for AI assistants and company profile. Conditional rendering for . Restructured Atendimentos into a 3-column layout. Reduced main menu button sizes and added CRM, Agenda, Mensagens Programadas shortcuts. Added state management for various modals (add contact, new appointment, scheduled message). Fixed  component import from . Contains the modals for Add Contact, New Appointment, and New Scheduled Message, dynamically rendered based on state. The Add Contact modal was significantly debugged and relocated in the DOM for correct rendering.
    -   : Public-facing landing page.
        -   **Importance**: Serves as the initial entry point, displaying marketing content and handling initial user authentication.
        -   **Changes**: Integrated login/registration modal functionality. Changed mock authentication to real API calls. Debugged and fixed authentication issues, including displaying specific error messages and adding demo credentials directly to the modal for user convenience. Handled demo page redirection.
-   : New directory for the Chrome extension.
    -   : Defines the extension's properties, permissions, and scripts.
    -   : Background script for handling events and long-running tasks.
    -   , , : Files for the extension's popup UI.
    -   : Content script to inject CRM interface into WhatsApp Web.
    -   : CSS for the injected CRM interface.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer initiated the implementation of a new, significant feature: a **Google Chrome Extension** to transform WhatsApp Web into a powerful sales and CRM tool, following detailed user requirements. This includes features like Kanban CRM, mass messaging, scheduled messages, auto-responder, automatic status posting, and interactive buttons for both customers and agents.

The work has begun by establishing the foundational architecture for the Chrome Extension. This involved:
1.  Creating the dedicated  directory.
2.  Setting up the core extension files:
    *   : Defining the extension's metadata and permissions.
    *   : For background processes.
    *   , , : For the extension's user interface accessible via the browser icon.
    *   : The primary content script designed to inject the CRM interface directly into the WhatsApp Web page.
    *   : For styling the injected CRM UI.
3.  Initiating the integration with the existing backend by adding new endpoints in . These endpoints are designed to support multi-company functionalities and specific Chrome Extension data synchronization, although the full scope of these endpoints is still under development.

The last action performed was restarting the backend services after adding these new API endpoints to , preparing for the next phase of integration and testing.
