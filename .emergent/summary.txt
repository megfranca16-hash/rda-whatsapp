The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Empresas Web CRM project, starting with user input on LLM API keys (Emergent LLM chosen). The development proceeded in iterative phases. Core CRM functionalities, department management, and basic AI integration were established. Significant effort was dedicated to refactoring MongoDB ObjectIDs to UUIDs for JSON serialization and correctly loading environment variables, resolving critical backend issues. Following user feedback, the focus shifted to implementing a Youseller inspired UI, incorporating 7 specialized AI assistants, advanced signature management, and a dedicated administrator area. The project is currently enhancing authentication and the public-facing landing page, transitioning towards a fully functional system based on a detailed user specification, delivered through rapid, incremental improvements rather than a full rebuild.

<product_requirements>
The Empresas Web application is a modern CRM system aiming for deep WhatsApp Web integration and advanced AI capabilities, mimicking the YouSeler experience. Initial core features included: modern CRM UI, QR Code-based WhatsApp Web integration, and AI functionalities (chatbot, virtual assistant) using ChatGPT and Gemini via the Emergent LLM key.

The scope evolved significantly to include:
- A responsive, PWA web app with a floating sidebar, dynamic content areas, and a vibrant hero section with gradient backgrounds.
- Dual WhatsApp integration (official Cloud API and non-official QR), supporting multiple numbers per department, reconnections, and session persistence.
- Seven specialized AI assistants per department, configurable with editable names, departments, avatars, manual instructions, fixed signatures, and multimedia interpretation (text, audio, image, PDF).
- Two automated message chatbots for out-of-office/recess messages.
- A comprehensive administrator area for managing company profile (logo, business hours, social media), users, departments, and AI settings, with RBAC and audit trails.
- Enhanced Atendimento (WhatsApp) interface with a 3-column layout (conversation list, chat thread, contact/CRM panel), full ReplyBar functionality (attachments, emojis, quick replies, PTT, AI Assist, scheduling, mandatory signatures), contact management (auto-save, labels), group participation, and real-time updates via WebSocket.
- CRM with Kanban funnels, automations based on keywords, and mass sending capabilities.
- Robust security features including on-premise default data storage, 2FA, encryption, and granular RBAC.
- An AI orchestrator to select optimal models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) with local execution option (Ollama) and adherence to prompts/context.
The user explicitly prioritized rapid evolution of the existing system over a complete rebuild.

<code_architecture>
The application is a full-stack web application with distinct frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) components.



**High-Level Architecture:**
The React frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend using  and  prefix for routes. The backend interacts with a MongoDB database via . Services are managed by Supervisor within a Kubernetes environment. AI capabilities are integrated via  library, utilizing the Emergent LLM key for various LLMs.
